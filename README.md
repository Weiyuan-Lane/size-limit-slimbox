Prelude
=========
This is an extension to Christophe Beyls's Slimbox 2 implementation, featuring an additional option to allow for limitations of the displayed image when Slimbox loads so that it doesn't load past the current screen width.

Please refer to the [original wiki page](https://github.com/cbeyls/slimbox/wiki/) for the in depth explanation on how slimbox works.

The addition found in this extension can be enabled / disabled via the additional options when setting up slimbox
* **limit:** Boolean; if set to false, reverts to original slimbox implementation where displayed images are not limited by screen size. Default value is true, where the automated limiting occurs.

For rest of the options in the original implementation, visit the [setup](https://github.com/cbeyls/slimbox/wiki/jQuery-Manual#setup) page.

Slimbox 2
=========

Slimbox 2 is a lightweight visual clone of the popular [Lightbox 2](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) script by Lokesh Dhakar, written using the [jQuery](http://jquery.com) javascript library. It was designed to be very small, efficient, standards-friendly, fully customizable, more convenient and 100% compatible with the original Lightbox 2.
