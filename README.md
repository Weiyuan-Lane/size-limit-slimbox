Prelude
=========
This is an extension to Christophe Beyls's Slimbox 2 implementation, featuring an additional option to allow for limitations of the displayed image when Slimbox loads so that it doesn't load past the current screen width.

Slimbox 2
=========

Slimbox 2 is a lightweight visual clone of the popular [Lightbox 2](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) script by Lokesh Dhakar, written using the [jQuery](http://jquery.com) javascript library. It was designed to be very small, efficient, standards-friendly, fully customizable, more convenient and 100% compatible with the original Lightbox 2.
